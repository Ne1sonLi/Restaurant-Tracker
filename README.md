# Vancouver  Hunger

## Phase 0

Vancouver Hunger is a desktop application that will have many restaurants located in the greater Vancouver area. There
will be restaurants for many types of cuisines. From sushi to dessert to tacos, Vancouver Hunger, will surely have a
place that will satiate its user's taste buds. Moreover, it will allow user's to add different restaurants to their
**favourite** list as well as their **try-next** list. By having these two lists separate from all the restaurants the
user can easily locate their favourite restaurants as well as the ones that they have bookmarked as their next place to
visit. In their favourites list, users will be able to add a *rating* out of 10 and some *comments* about the restaurant
such as a drink or item that they got. Overall, this application will help expose its user's to a bunch of different
cuisines near the greater Vancouver area and allow them to keep track of what restaurants they enjoyed and which ones to
try next.

The main user's of this application will be those who either live in the greater Vancouver area and are keen of trying
new places to eat or tourists who are planning to visit. Furthermore, it can also be used by a myriad of UBC students as
not everyone is from the greater Vancouver area. Therefore, they could use it to get some ideas on where to eat during
their next meal out with friends. This application interests me because I enjoy food a lot. When I go hang out with
friends we also enjoy trying out new restaurants but usually don't know which ones to try. Thus, by having an
application like this, we can recommend our favourite restaurants to each other and provide then with the comments we
made about the restaurant such as *"Try the lobster, it was amazing!"* so that we can have the best experience at that
restaurant.
