# Vancouver  Hunger

## Phase 0

Vancouver Hunger is a desktop application that will have many restaurants located in the greater Vancouver area. There
will be restaurants for many types of cuisines. From sushi to dessert to tacos, Vancouver Hunger, will surely have a
place that will satiate its user's taste buds. Moreover, it will allow user's to add different restaurants to two
different lists:

- **Favourite**
- **Try-next**

By having these two lists separate from all the restaurants the user can easily locate their favourite restaurants as
well as the ones that they have bookmarked as their next place to visit. In their favourites list, users will be able 
to add a **rating** out of 10

Overall, this application will help expose its user's to a bunch of different cuisines near the greater Vancouver area
and allow them to keep track of what restaurants they enjoyed and which ones to try next.

The main user's of this application will be those who either live in the greater Vancouver area and are keen of trying
new places to eat or tourists who are planning to visit. Furthermore, it can also be used by a myriad of UBC students as
not everyone is from the greater Vancouver area. Therefore, they could use it to get some ideas on where to eat during
their next meal out with friends. This application interests me because I enjoy food a lot. When I go hang out with
friends we also enjoy trying out new restaurants but usually don't know which ones to try. Thus, by having an
application like this, we can recommend our favourite restaurants to each other so that we can have the best experience 
at that restaurant.
